# Advent of Code 2023

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) adventures for [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), this time in Golang.

I'm using AoC 2023 as a chance to learn Golang. For the first few exercises I used my existing
[adventofcode Git repository](https://github.com/foax/adventofcode), but I found that this is not conducive to being able
to easily execute unit tests.
